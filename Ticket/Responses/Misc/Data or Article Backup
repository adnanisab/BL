Hi,

We do daily backups. However, there is one time charge of $150 if you request data in the middle of the service. If you decide to discontinue (which I hope not) then we provide data free of cost.

We will provide your archives in comma-delimited format that can be imported in your new database.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Thank you.
