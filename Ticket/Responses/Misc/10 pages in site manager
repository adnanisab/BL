Hi,

For performance reasons we do not allow more than 10 pages in all areas of Site Manager.

Furthermore, we have very powerful "search" functions. For advanced examples of search, please click on "Tutorials" link that you see on top under Site Manager and click on "34. Site Manager Search".

Let us know if you have further questions.

Thank you.
