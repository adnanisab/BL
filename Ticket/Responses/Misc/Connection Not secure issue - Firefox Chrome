Hi,

Browsers such as Firefox and Chrome have made certain updates pertaining to the Password entry field. This is an issue which is of no harm. Its been like this since the inception of the internet. Therefore, you should not panic on this issue for now, however we have passed this to the development group for possible future changes and we will continue to monitor.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Thank you.
