Hi,

We have added a new hidden security feature which is more secure than text captcha. This captcha is not allowing auto-filling text fields for security reasons.

However, you can click on the "User Name" field and it will show you saved login details. You can click on it to auto-fill both text fields. Below is the screenshot.

Please let us know how it works.

Thank you.
