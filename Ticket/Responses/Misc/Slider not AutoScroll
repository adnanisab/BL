We are forced to make changes as someone has a patent on the slider that includes automatic slides, goes to different URLs upon clicks, etc.

It is ironic there are some people who patent common things and attempt to make money from businesses. Hence, we have decided to alter the slider by removing auto slider so it does not infringe patent holders. Even Apple.com ran into the same issue and they ended up going to the court. We have virtually put all the basic functions of the slider so your users will not notice them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for understanding.
