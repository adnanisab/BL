Hi,

Your current template and Template#1XX are different templates. Hence template change you need to aware of the following things.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Contents of your current template will remain same.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Look and feel (theme, color, fonts) everything will be same as new template however you can customize it but it will take time to get usual.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. You will have to re-size all Ads (Images, Widgets etc.).

&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Initially your site will look like it is mess-up until you re-size all images.

Please let us know your thoughts to proceed further.

Thank you.
