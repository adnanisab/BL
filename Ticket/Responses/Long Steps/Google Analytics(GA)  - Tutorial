Hi Mitch,

We use Google Analytics(GA) services for website statistics. GA is a free service offered by Google that generates detailed statistics about the visitors to your website including click and views on your pages, banner ads, etc.

We have itemized your website links for easy reporting in Google Analytics system. For example, when people click on ads, you will see links starting with "AD:xxxxx". Where "xxxxx" is your ad name. Here is the list of itemized links that you can search in Google Analytics system:

AD:
MENU:
PAGE:
HIGHLIGHT:
HEADLINE:
CLASSIFIED:
FORM:
PHOTO:
POLL:
YELLOWPAGE:
PRODUCT:

Please refer "Tutorial" chapter "23. Website Statistics" on how to use website statistics with Google Analytics.

Thank you.
