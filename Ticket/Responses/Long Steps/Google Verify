Hi,

Google provides more than one option such as 'Meta Tag', 'HTML File', etc. for verifying your site.

Select 'Meta Tag' option and the code looks like the following:

<meta name='google-site-verification' content='H7qHgGh7qHL9Zogxnau4hhZ_5b7EqdO5oJ9QE4w92Ac' />

Please visit below link, search for "Verification method details" and click on "HTML tag" for more information.
