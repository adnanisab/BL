We have also tried to share an article on our Facebook page and we are facing the same below error.

We don't have any control to make any changes as error showing from Facebook. However, you can directly share the article URL on your Facebook page.

Please follow the below steps,

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Click on "Articles" icon from "Site Manager".

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Click on the "view" of the article which you want to share.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Copy article URL from the address bar.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Now, visit your Facebook page and paste the article URL to share.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. You might need to wait for 2 to 5 seconds for URL to load thumbnail of your article and then you can share it.

Please let us know how it works.

Thank you.
