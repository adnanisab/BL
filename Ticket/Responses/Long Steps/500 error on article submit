Hi,

Below are few things which will cause error-500, you should avoid it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Image file name in non-english character. Please use English or numeric characters in filename.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Image file having larger than 5 MB size.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Very long heading of the article. You should try short heading.

Still if you are facing issue to upload new article, please provide article's details such as heading text, picture file etc.. We will try it to see how it works.

Send details on support@bulletlink.com and make sure to mention ticket number in subject line.

Thank you.
